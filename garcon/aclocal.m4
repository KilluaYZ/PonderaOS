# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to '$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# '$srcdir', '$srcdir/..', or '$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

# AM_PROG_INSTALL_STRIP
# ---------------------
# One issue with vendor 'install' (even GNU) is that you can't
# specify the program used to strip binaries.  This is especially
# annoying in cross-compiling environments, where the build's strip
# is unlikely to handle the host's binaries.
# Fortunately install-sh will honor a STRIPPROG variable, so we
# always use install-sh in "make install-strip", and initialize
# STRIPPROG with the value of the STRIP variable (set by the user).

dnl XDT_CHECK_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE(varname, package, version, optionname, helpstring, [default])
dnl
dnl Checks for an optional dependency on "package" >= "version". "default"
dnl can be "yes" or "no" (defaults to "yes" if not specified) and controls
dnl whether configure should check this dependency by default, or only if
dnl the user explicitly enables it using a command line switch.
dnl
dnl This macro automatically adds a commandline switch based on the "optionname"
dnl parameter (--enable-optionname/--disable-optionname), which allows the
dnl user to explicitly control whether this optional dependency should be
dnl enabled or not. The "helpstring" parameter gives a brief(!) description
dnl about this dependency.
dnl
dnl If the user chose to enable this dependency and the required package
dnl was found, this macro defines the variable "varname"_FOUND and sets it
dnl to the string "yes", in addition to the 4 variables set by XDT_CHECK_PACKAGE.
dnl But "varname"_FOUND will not be marked for substition. Furthermore,
dnl a CPP define HAVE_"varname" will be placed in config.h (or added to
dnl the cc command line, depending on your configure.ac) and set to
dnl 1.

dnl XDT_CHECK_OPTIONAL_FEATURE(varname, optionname, dependency-checks, [helpstring], [default])
dnl
dnl Introduces an --enable-optionname/--disable-optionname flag pair for a
dnl named feature. If neither flag is provided, the feature will be enabled or
dnl disabled depending on whether or not dependency-checks succeed or fail.
dnl If --enable-optionname is provided, the configure script will error out if
dnl the dependencies are not met.  If --disable-optionname is provided, the
dnl feature will be disabled, and dependencies will not be checked.
dnl
dnl The dependency-checks argument should be a series of
dnl XDT_FEATURE_DEPENDENCY() macro calls, passed as a single quoted argument to
dnl XDT_CHECK_OPTIONAL_FEATURE().
dnl
dnl If helpstring is not provided, optionname is used instead.
dnl
dnl The default is "auto", and semantics are as described above. If default is
dnl set to "yes", then the feature will be required unless --disable-optionname
dnl is passed to configure.  If default is set to "no", the feature will not be
dnl built unless --enable-optionname is passed.
dnl
dnl If the feature is enabled and dependencies are met, ENABLE_varname will be
dnl defined in config.h. Additionally, an automake conditional called
dnl ENABLE_varname will be created, and a shell variable called ENABLE_varname
dnl will set to "yes" or "no".
dnl
dnl Example usage:

dnl --------
dnl  Version initialization M4 macros.
dnl


dnl XDT_VERSION_INIT(SEMVER, [TAG])
dnl
dnl This macro takes care of setting up the version numbering.
dnl
dnl It will define the following macros based on SEMVER and TAG:
dnl
dnl  - xdt_version
dnl  - xdt_version_major
dnl  - xdt_version_minor
dnl  - xdt_version_micro
dnl  - xdt_version_tag
dnl  - xdt_version_build
dnl  - xdt_debug_default
dnl
dnl If TAG isn't specified, the xdt_version_tag and xdt_version_git
dnl will be empty and xdt_debug_default will be set to "minimum",
dnl otherwise the xdt_version_build will contain a git hash and
dnl xdt_debug_default will be set to "yes"
dnl
dnl Example usage:
dnl
dnl XDT_VERSION_INIT([4.15.3],[git])
dnl AC_INIT([xfce4-someproject],[xdt_version()])
dnl ...
dnl XDT_FEATURE_DEBUG([xdt_debug_default])
