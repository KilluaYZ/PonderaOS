    org.xfce.Thunar

    The Thunar specific interface, which provides Thunar specific
    methods, and which should not be implemented by any other
    file manager.

    This interface is also subject to change. So, unless you know
    what you are doing, and you want to limit yourself to Thunar,
    do not use this interface, but use org.xfce.FileManager instead.

      BulkRename (working_directory : STRING, filenames : ARRAY OF STRING, standalone : BOOLEAN, display : STRING, startup_id : STRING) : VOID

      working_directory : the default directory for the "Add Files" dialog of the
                          bulk rename window. May also be the empty string, in
                          which case the current working directory of the file
                          manager process will be used. This is also used to
                          translated relative file paths in the filenames below
                          to absolute paths.
      filenames         : the list of file:-URIs or absolute paths that should
                          appear in the bulk renamer list by default. May also
                          be an empty list. any file that is neither an absolute
                          path nor a file:-URI will be translated into an
                          absolute path relative to the working_directory.
      standalone        : TRUE if the bulk rename dialog should appear like a
                          standalone application. This is usually what you want.
                          It should only be FALSE when invoked from another file
                          management tool and its obvious to the user that a
                          bunch of selected files will be renamed.
      display           : the screen on which to launch the filenames or ""
                          to use the default screen of the file manager.
      startup_id        : the DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment variable for properly
                           handling startup notification and focus stealing.
